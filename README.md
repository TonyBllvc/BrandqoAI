# BrandqoAI

An AI-powered WhatsApp assistant and dashboard that helps creators plan, generate and schedule on-brand content to Instagram, Facebook and X/Twitter.

---

## Overview

Many small businesses struggle to maintain a consistent and engaging presence on social media. BrandqoAI solves this by acting as an always-on social media manager. Business owners simply register their details and connect their accounts, and the AI handles the rest, from generating an editable content calendar to automatically designing on-brand flyers and publishing posts based on a set schedule.

---

## Features

- **WhatsApp creator bot**: Chat-first onboarding and content generation in WhatsApp.
- **Brand-aware AI**: Captures your brand voice, audience, and content pillars to guide all output.
- **Content & poster generation**: Creates post ideas, captions, and poster prompts (or full images via an image API).
- **Multi-platform scheduling**: Schedule posts to Instagram, Facebook, and X/Twitter from one place.
- **Web dashboard**: Calendar view, brand preferences, and social account management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Redis** instance (for scheduled jobs)
- A Meta developer account (for WhatsApp Business Cloud API & Meta Graph APIs)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Techabode/BrandqoAI.git
cd BrandqoAI
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd ../backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### 3. Set up environment variables

In `backend/`, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in the required values
```

#### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Description                  | Required |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Yes      |

#### Database setup 🗄️

Before you can use the API you must migrate the schema into your database. The project uses
Prisma migrations, which are stored in `backend/prisma/migrations`.

A helper make command bootstraps the initial migration for you, so you never need to call
`npx prisma` manually. Run this once when you first clone the repo:

```bash
# on your host machine, after installing backend dependencies
make migrate-init
```

This will generate and apply the first migration to whatever database `DATABASE_URL` points at
(defaults to `localhost:5442` used by `make up-db`).

After the migration files exist you can bring up the app in Docker. Because the migration
directory must be copied into the image, rebuild the backend before deploying the migrations:

```bash
make build          # include migrations in image
make migrate        # apply them inside the backend container
```

The `User` table (and all others) will then be present and the registration endpoint will work.

`make migrate` is safe to run repeatedly; it will say "No pending migrations to apply" if the
database is already up to date.

```bash
# optionally seed data
make seed
```

| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection URL | Yes |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for backend auth | Yes |
| `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN` | | Yes |
| `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET` | | Yes |
| `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITTER_CLIENT-SECRET` | For X/Twitter integration | Optional |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Any AI provider keys | Yes |

In `frontend/`, create a `.env.local` file for any public/front-end configuration (API base URL, etc.).

#### 4. Run the apps

From `backend/` and `frontend/` respectively:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **API docs**: While the backend is running you can view the automatically generated Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:4000/docs`.

## Project Roadmap

High-level roadmap lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). It follows these phases:

1. **Foundations & Auth** – core backend/frontend scaffolding and auth.
2. **WhatsApp & basic AI** – onboarding flow and simple content generation.
3. **Dashboard & social connections** – web UI and OAuth integrations.
4. **Scheduling & posting engine** – queues and workers for post publishing.
5. **Poster generation & UX polish** – better creatives and smoother flows.
6. **Hardening & launch** – testing, logging, and beta feedback.

See [CHANGELOG.md] for the full version history.
